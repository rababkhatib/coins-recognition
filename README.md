# Coins recognition
Coin collecting has been a practice since ancient times and recently the web saw popping some online repositories to simplify this massive classification work. This project aims to simplify coins recognition thanks to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
Who said numismatics was only for humans?

## Data
The retained data set is made up of 32 different currencies and all the coins images and labels used in this projects can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wanderdust/coin-images). Each of the 211 coins can be found in multiple copies in all of our three directories : train, validation and test. We can count a total of 6413 training images and 844 validation ones.
